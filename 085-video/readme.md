node js is a run time environment which is used to run js outside browser
Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

It allows you to build things like:
Web servers
Backend APIs
Command-line tools

Why we use Node.js:
You can use JavaScript for both frontend and backend.
It's fast (non-blocking I/O).
It has a huge ecosystem of libraries.



NPM = Node Package Manager
It is a tool that comes with Node.js
Used to install and manage libraries (packages) made by others (like express, mongoose, etc.)
Why use NPM:
Saves time — don’t reinvent the wheel.
Easily manage project dependencies.
Share your own packages.



package.json is a file created in your project when you run:
npm init
It stores:
Your project name, version, etc.
All the dependencies you installed
Scripts (e.g., how to start your app)


What is package-lock.json?
This file iss automatically generated by NPM.
Locks the exact versions of installed packages.
Ensures consistency across different machines or teams.
Why it matters: Even if your package.json says:
"express": "^4.18.0"
The package-lock.json locks it to a specific version like 4.18.2.


What is node_modules/?
This is a folder where all your installed dependencies go.
When you run:
npm install
NPM:
Looks at package.json
Installs required packages
Puts them inside the node_modules/ folder
